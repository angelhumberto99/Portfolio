      "The UDG (Universidad de Guadalajara) has at its disposal its own system for the financial management of its academic centers known as the SIGI system (Integral Management and Information System).",
      "Unfortunately, the UDG software development team, in addition to their tasks as programmers, also had to be in charge of answering questions and reports on the SIGI platform, which greatly hindered the development of other systems.",
      "The solution given to the previous problem was achieved thanks to the Assist project, which was in charge of attending to the most recurring issues through artificial intelligence and delegating those more complex incidents to technical personnel.",
      "One month after its implementation, the reports sent through means outside the same platform have almost completely ceased, and the user experience of the SIGI system has improved, since the vast majority of problems can be attended to immediately instead of wait hours or days until a technical assistant solves it for us."
